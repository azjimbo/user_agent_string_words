Ever curious about user agents?  This is a way to look at the words discovered in user agent strings.

It also uses a {sets} command to help present the results in a unique columnar way.  

This presents unique words found in user agent strings as recorded in the Web datamodel. (>2 characters long). 

You can search for individual words using the search box. You can filter by clicking on a word into a drilldown below. 

In the resulting drilldown you will find all the source IPs that had presented that user agent string word, clicking one of those will present another drilldown that shows all the different user agent strings presented by that particular IP address. 

There are a number of words that are pre-excluded. These are ones that I just find annoying and prolific. Also the entire "Expanse, a Palo Alto ... " user agent string is hard coded out. Edit the underlying query if you want to include that back in.
